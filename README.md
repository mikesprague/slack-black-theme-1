**Note:**

- These instructions are error handled in the script.
- Please restart/close powershell if you have installed NodeJS during this install. This will refresh your environment variables to which NodeJS/Windows uses for commands. If you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed just type `refreshenv` while in powershell and run the install command below without closing/restarting powershell.

## Install

To install theme just open powershell as administrator (Refer to #4 above) and run this command below.
